#  Getting and Cleaning Data - Course project

## Introduction
This assignment is the Course Project for the Johns Hopkins University course: Getting and Cleaning Data
This course is offered through the Coursera MOOC website

## Part 1 - Merge Training and Test Data
## =====================================

- Load the train data
- Load the test data
- Load the label data
- Create column names in the data frames
- Replace activity codes with descriptive activity names
- add the subject and activity to the main data frames
- merge the data to create one data set

## Part 2 - Create the Independent Tidy Data Set
## =============================================

- Select only those measurements that relate to mean and standard deviation of each measurement
 This is step 2 assignment instructions.  However, I found it easier to do this step after the merging
- Group this result set by Activity and Subject
- Create a new tidy data set that contains the average of each variable for each activity and subject
- write the tidy data set to a txt file
